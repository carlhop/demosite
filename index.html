				<h2>Intro</h2>
				<div class="a">
					<p><big>Welcome to my demo website. Here you will see different skillsets I have practiced and implemented. I am a 25 year old native of Montgomery, AL. I am an alumni of Alabama State University with a degree in Computer Science
		My goal is to become a software engineer/developer for a company that I can grow and become successful with. My spare time hobbies include working out, learning new coding skillsets, and playing Grand Theft Auto 5. This website
		will serve as a demo that I will use to practice my skills. You will see a range of implemetations from html, to css, and maybe even some javascript.</big></p>

		<h2>Early Life</h2>
		<div class="a">
			<p><big>	I, Carl Reginald Hopkins was born April 10<sup>th</sup>, 1997 at 5:02 pm in Montgomery, AL. During my childhood I took an interest in computers. This was first noticed as I used to take apart certain parts of the PC and
		and put them back together whenever something was wrong with the computer. Sports were always a main passion, but outside of that it was always computers. It also helped that my grandfather worked with computers while in the
	Air Force, it made it feel like it was natural for me to have this interest in dealing with computers. Even though I had this interest I never thought that I'd go on to become a software engineer.</big></p>

		<h2>College Life</h2>
		<div class="a">
			<p><big>	My college days originally started at Alabama A&M University. Upon applying I viewed different majoors they had listed and looked for "Computer Engineering". Funny story about this is my goal going into college was to fix
		on the hardware of the computers. Going into the college process completely blind I chose Computer Science unaware that this meant I'll be working with the software of the computer instead of the hardware of the computer.
	 After a few weeks I finally approached my instructor and told her what I really wanted to major in an what my plans were. She stated that Computer Engineering fell under Electrical Engineering. Once she informed me of that she also warned
 of the curriculum. The next day I went to look at the curriculum for Electrical Engineering and let's say I decided I'd be better off sticking with Computer Science. Eventually I transferred to Alabbama State University were I lost major
credits and was dropped from a senior to a sophomore, but graduated May 7<sup>th</sup>, 2021. There were major differences between the two institutions. While A&M was more tech than State, the teachers at State taught fluently
compared to those at A&M.</big></p>

	<h2>Career Goals</h2>
	<div class="a">
		<p><big>If you have made it this far I first would like to say thank you. Choosing a career as a Software Engineer/Developer was a turning point in my life. I pkan on being one of the best to ever touch a keyboard. My current journey has
taught me so far that this will not be something that will be given to me easily. In order to be the best you have to eat, sleep, breathe, and live your craft. It has to be something that you enjoy or else it will mean nothing to you.
My first goal is to find a stable environment that I can leanr, improve, and grow as an engineer. My second goal is to create a world changing project. Some thing life changing to not only me but the world. Lastly, my goal is to perfect
everything I set out to do. Every programming language and every technique, I plan on perfecting them all.</big></p>
